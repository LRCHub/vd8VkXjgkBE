Give me emotion

Give me emotion
Emotion

Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be prou-oud

You tell me why
When you come to me
You want too long
All the things I do
I try, and try
And you know it's true
To show you I need you
What you want to believe

Give me emotion
Give me emotion
Give me emotion
When you come to me

Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be proud
Don't be prou-oud

I know your pride
If I'm helping you
I don't know how
You can things to prove
And there is why
You can still feel free
Your rhythm come to try
Trying it with me

Give me emotion
Give me emotion
Give me emotion
If I'm helping you
