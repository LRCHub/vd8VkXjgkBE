[00:02.63] The question is wouldn't mama be proud?
[00:09.36] There's a silver lining in the corporate cloud
[00:17.70] And the pretty post that you're taking as
[00:20.97] As an NCO of the great pretender
[00:31.18] I should sure think so
[00:42.18] 
[00:33.81] Wouldn't mama be proud?
[00:45.31] 
[00:41.67] "Can i take your order?"
[00:45.70] Asks the heavenly host
[00:49.55] Ticket to the jetstream
[00:53.14] Blowing coast to coast
[01:04.14] 
[00:56.85] The long stemmed glasses, a movie
[01:00.97] And a pleasant dream in mid air
[01:06.67] You gotta tell me quickly
[01:10.94] 'Cause we're almost there
[01:23.44] 
[01:13.67] Wouldn't mama be proud?
[01:25.17] 
[01:21.07] Pointed out of the window
[01:25.18] At the sky gone black
[01:29.13] Kid you're on the right track
[01:43.63] 
[01:49.53] If I send you postcards
[01:53.18] From the side of the road
[01:57.26] Photographs of moving
[02:00.82] Parts about to explode
[02:11.82] 
[02:05.37] If I call to keep it together
[02:08.92] Like you say i can do
[02:13.36] To transmit a moment
[02:19.20] From me to you
[02:26.20]
