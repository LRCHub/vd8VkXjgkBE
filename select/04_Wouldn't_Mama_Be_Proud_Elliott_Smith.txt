The question is wouldn't mama be proud?
There's a silver lining in the corporate cloud
And the pretty post that you're taking as
As an NCO of the great pretender
I should sure think so
Wouldn't mama be proud?
"Can I take your order?"
Asks the heavenly host
Ticket to the jet-stream
Blowing coast to coast
The long stem glasses, a movie
And a pleasant dream in mid air
"You gotta tell me quickly
'Cause we're almost there"
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Pointed out of the window
At the sky gone black
"Kid you're on the right track"
If I send you postcards
From the side of the road
Photographs of moving
Parts about to implode
If I crawl to keep it together
Like you say you know I can do
To transmit a moment
From me to you
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
Wouldn't mama be proud?
